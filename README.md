# SPA Playground: Miso
Playing around with Miso SPAs and structuring them for larger scale applications. The purpose is to avoid servers, so we are explicitly not aiming at an isomorphic setup, but purely SPA.

**To Do:**

The goal is to somewhat replicate the setup achieved in [the Elm SPA playground](https://github.com/Tehnix/playground-spa-elm):

- [ ] Routing
- [ ] GraphQL
- [ ] Material UI (might need to make a wrapper for this)
- [ ] I18n
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Doc Tests

## Developing

We'll use Nix to manage our tools and build our project. Nix is the best option when GHCJS is involved, so we'll set up our toolchain around working with that.

If you haven't set up Nix then [follow these steps if you are on macOS](https://gist.github.com/Tehnix/38efa7ff1215ae49bf17925ce1684266#setting-up-nix), or simply run `sh <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon` on Linux.

After you have Nix running, set up the tools,

```bash
$ nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install # Install cachix for quick builds
$ cachix use hercules-ci # Add general cachix
$ cachix use miso-haskell # Add Miso's cachix
$ nix-env -iA cabal-install entr ag -f '<nixpkgs>' # Install a few of our build-tools
$ nix-env -iA ghcide-ghc865 -f https://github.com/hercules-ci/ghcide-nix/tarball/master # Set up GHCIDE for GHC 8.6.5
```

Run `ghcid` (typechecking, warnings, etc) in a terminal with,

```bash
$ nix-shell --run dev
```

Run our site on `http://localhost:8080` with hot-reloading (broken until [jsaddle#107](https://github.com/ghcjs/jsaddle/issues/107) is fixed),

```bash
$ nix-shell --run reload
```

This works by [switching between GHC and GHCJS](https://github.com/dmjio/miso/blob/master/sample-app-jsaddle/Main.hs#L32-L40) depending on the target.

## Building for Release

```bash
$ nix-build -A release
```

## Setup

### ðŸš§ GraphQL ðŸš§

We'll use [morpheus](https://github.com/morpheusgraphql/morpheus-graphql).

### ðŸš§ Material UI ðŸš§

Material-UI could potentially be ported easily by using [material-components-web-elm](https://github.com/aforemny/material-components-web-elm/tree/2.0.1) as the base, and then migrating the [Elm files](https://github.com/aforemny/material-components-web-elm/tree/2.0.1/src/Material) to Miso/Haskell syntax


### ðŸš§ i18n ðŸš§
- i18n support can quickly be built, taking inspiration from [i18next-elm](https://github.com/ChristophP/elm-i18next/tree/4.0.0), which more or less just implements a [single file](https://github.com/ChristophP/elm-i18next/blob/4.0.0/src/I18Next.elm)

### ðŸš§ Verified Examples in Documentation ðŸš§

Look at [doctest](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/doctest)

### ðŸš§ CI ðŸš§

We use Github actions to build the project, run tests, and run doc tests in the CI pipeline. Check out the workflows in `.github/workflows/` to see the specific workflows that are set up.

## Resources

- [Getting Started Haskell Project with Nix](https://maybevoid.com/posts/2019-01-27-getting-started-haskell-nix.html)
- Take inspiration from the [web-haskell boilerplate](https://github.com/dandoh/web-haskell), which sets up GraphQL, dotenv, jwt etc
